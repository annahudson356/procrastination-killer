# Procrastination Killer

Have you ever opened Canvas only to be suprised when you see an assignment that you've missed or one that is unexpectedly due soon, unable to complete it in time? Well, we have too! We are here to make sure that you get your assignments done on time by making sure you 
do not miss due dates.



## About

This extension is super simple! It accomplishes the following four tasks

✔️ 1. Find the Canvas due dates on the page
✔️ 2. Convert them to real computer dates
✔️ 3. Adjust the dates to your “fake earlier date”
✔️ 4. Replace the visible text with your fake date
✔️ 5. Keep doing this as Canvas loads more content

Nothing else — no hacking, no modifying Canvas data, nothing dangerous. This is just a cosmetic change that 
tricks your brain into doing your assignment easier!



## Well, what if I remember that the assignment is due later? 

Well, we can only help with so much. The goal of this is to hack your brain to get the assignment done earlier. Our goal is that, especially with midday assignments as someone who works at night, it will be easier to do assignments without stress.
