# Procrastination Killer

Have you ever opened Canvas only to be surprised by an assignment that you’ve missed or one that’s suddenly due soon, leaving you scrambling to complete it in time? This extension helps make sure you get your assignments done on time by ensuring you don’t miss due dates.


## About

This extension is super simple! It does the following:

1. Finds the Canvas due dates on the page.
2. Converts them to real computer-readable dates.
3. Adjusts the dates to your “fake earlier date.”
4. Optionally truncates due dates to the night before (11:59 PM), which is perfect if you tend to work at night and want to avoid missing assignments that are due midday.
5. Replaces the visible text with your adjusted date.
6. Continues updating as Canvas loads more content dynamically.

Nothing else — no hacking, no modifying Canvas data, nothing dangerous. This is purely a cosmetic change designed to trick your brain into tackling assignments earlier.
